      "description": "Authors: @Gregory | ChainSafe\nType: Executable Proposal\nStatus: Snapshot Vote\nDate proposed: April 28th, 2022\nDate ratified:\nReferences\n\nYou can find the code snippet [here](https://gist.github.com/GregTheGreek/0638ddb7f35cde924b34e168fe8c328f) \n\n### Sentence Summary\nIncrease the current GSC quroum threshold to 3.\n\n### Paragraph Summary\n\nThis proposal exist to increase the quorum threshold on the GSC from one to three.\n\n### Motivation\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility.\n\nAs of today (April 28, 2022) there has only been one delegate (myself) who has proven their membership to the GSC on-chain. In roughly five days I will be able to pass votes by myself with no further approval because the current quroum threshold on the GSC is one. I believe that no one person should be able to govern the GSC by themselves, and thus I am proposing to effectively lock the GSC until two other delegates join the GSC. Three was chosen as a starting point for one reason, to break a tie. As more delegates join, I'm sure this value will gradually increase but for the time being, a threshold of three will be adequate to ensure some level of participation.\n\n### Specification / Proposal Details\n\n    Option A [YES] is a vote to increase the quroum threshold to three.\n    Option B [NO] is a vote to do nothing. \n",
